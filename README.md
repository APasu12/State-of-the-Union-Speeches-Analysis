Each Speech begins with the words "State of the Union Address" followed by the President's name and the date. This text is ignored in the analysis to ensure that the results are not skewed. Numbers, bolded text, hyperlinks, audience reactions, and information about Project Gutenberg are ignored in the analysis.

# Analysis
One of the highlighting features of the Mood-Word Intensity per Speech Heatmap is that Document 53 (State of the Union Speech of 2002) included an abnormally large amount of words that created a sense of "unity." This was President Bush's address to Congress following the 9/11 attacks (the "unity" tone makes sense), and overall, this heatmap allowed me to identify patterns in the mood of these speeches. The dictionary of words that defined these tones can be expanded upon in future analyses to create a more accurate heatmap.

Additionally, there is a very strong, positive correlation between Speeches 1-10 (1950-1960) and Speeches 35-45 (1984-1994), and this means that these speeches had very similar tones.

Single letters like "t", "f", and "s" were included in the Top Term graphs. This is most likely due to contractions like "wouldn't" or "China's" where the program causes "t" and "s" to be processed as separate words. This is very interesting to see that the program isn't able to differentiate between conjunctions (with explicitly writing the code for it). I purposely left the program as it is now since I wanted to see if this would impact the "Top Terms" results, which it ultimately did.
